	<string key="AboutDG">
		<value>
			Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
			Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
			The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
		</value>
	</string>
	<string key="AboutCupid">
		<value>

			Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
			Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
		</value>
	</string>
	<string key="AboutHunter">
		<value>

			A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
			Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
			If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!

	<string key="AboutSK">
		<value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

		<value>Did you know? The guard role can never appear alone. It does not always appear, but if it does, there will be a minimum of 2 (or more).</value>
		<value>Did you know? In the games, each role is unique, except for: villager, police, mason, guard, werewolf and cultist, who may not be. However, in superchaos mode, almost any role can be repeated.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The superchaos mode tends to repeat the roles. That is, someone with a repeated role is more reliable than someone who claims to have a role that nobody else has.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The alpha wolf, the mayor and Cupid are not repeated in superchaos mode. Everyone else does.</value>
		<value>Did you know? If the serial killer fails her attack because of the guards, she will kill one of them at random.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The herbalist is the role of the village with greater force. Therefore, like the seer, it must be hidden, since its death would put the villagers at a great disadvantage. If you are an angel or guard, do not hesitate to protect it!</value>
		<value>Did you know? The detective has improved his technique, and now it can only be discovered by normal wolves, alpha wolf and snooper wolf. The other wolves can no longer discover him.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The sheriff prevents them from converting the cult to their objectives, during the night he visits them, in addition to knowing if they leave home. Protect or investigate? Sheriff's life is not simple!</value>
		<value>Did you know? The harlot cannot differentiate the arsonist. However, it is still useful, because it can confirm itself as good thanks to its visits.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The healer can only revive village roles. That is, if someone died devoured and does not let you relive it, you can conclude that it was not from the village!</value>
		<value>Did you know? If someone appears dead as "Devoured", it means that he was killed by the voracious wolf, who can hide the role of his victims to confuse the village.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The ninja has been training, and now he can hide several nights in a row, provided he has been attacked in the previous one. However, if he hides and is not attacked, he must rest next night.</value>
		<value>Did you know? Each role has some resistance to being converted by cultists. You can check it using the / cult command followed by the role emoji.</value>
		<value>Did you know? There are two wolves that do not eat, and have supportive actions: the snow wolf and the snooper. If you are a wolf, keep this in mind, and do not vote to eat the same one they visited, as (normally) you would waste their ability.</value>
		<value>Did you know? This bot allows to play games of only 4 people, but certain roles such as the harlot, damn or alpha wolf are deactivated in those games.</value>
		<value>Did you know? This bot allows you to play games of up to 50 players. In addition, the tanner role is deactivated from the 30 players, to enjoy the special games in full.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The clumsy villager has 50% of lynching a random person. But that random person may be the same one who initially voted. That is, if there are 2 people left to vote, you have 75% of the right vote!</value>

Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you have dig. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but they might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt their leg, causing them to maybe lose control over who is their victim the next night...</value>

			Note: If the player converts to the Cult(the one you choose), you will get his original role. For the rest the normal rules will apply: if he was the wild child and his role model is dead, you will become a werewolf. If not, you will take his role model.
			The Cult cannot convert to necromancer (but after changing roles). Caution: The necromancer cannot win if it has not changed roles. If at the end of the game, the necromancer still does not become the role of a dead person, he loses (exception: lovers).
