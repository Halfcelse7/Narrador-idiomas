			Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
			The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)

	<string key="AboutHunter">
		<value>

			A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
			Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
			If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!

		<value>Did you know? I am an advice. We can appear randomly during games, to share curious information about the bot. Will you manage to read them all?</value>

		<value>Did you know? In the games, each role is unique, except for: villager, police, mason, guard, werewolf and cultist, who may not be. However, in superchaos mode, almost any role can be repeated.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The superchaos mode tends to repeat the roles. That is, someone with a repeated role is more reliable than someone who claims to have a role that nobody else has.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The alpha wolf, the mayor and Cupid are not repeated in superchaos mode. Everyone else does.</value>
		<value>Did you know? If the serial killer fails her attack because of the guards, she will kill one of them at random.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The herbalist is the role of the village with greater force. Therefore, like the seer, it must be hidden, since its death would put the villagers at a great disadvantage. If you are an angel or guard, do not hesitate to protect it!</value>
		<value>Did you know? The detective has improved his technique, and now it can only be discovered by normal wolves, alpha wolf and snooper wolf. The other wolves can no longer discover him.</value>
		<value>Did you know? The sheriff prevents them from converting the cult to their objectives, during the night he visits them, in addition to knowing if they leave home. Protect or investigate? Sheriff's life is not simple!</value>

Everyone who visits you has a chance of falling into your newly dug graves, depending on how many graves you have dig. Also, the chance is halved for everyone who is on the village team with you. But since you are out at night, the wolves or the serial killer might spot and kill you, and the more graves you have to dig, the more likely it is. Also, apparently the serial killer can find you whether you're at home or not, but they might at least stumble in one of your graves and hurt their leg, causing them to maybe lose control over who is their victim the next night...</value>

			The Necromancer has the possibility to choose the role of someone already dead. At night, the necromancer can choose to become the role of a dead person for the rest of the game. You cannot win a game like the Necromancer. Necromancer and Doppelgänger will not appear in the same game.
			Note: If the player converts to the Cult(the one you choose), you will get his original role. For the rest the normal rules will apply: if he was the wild child and his role model is dead, you will become a werewolf. If not, you will take his role model.
			The Cult cannot convert to necromancer (but after changing roles). Caution: The necromancer cannot win if it has not changed roles. If at the end of the game, the necromancer still does not become the role of a dead person, he loses (exception: lovers).
